## Aim
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts.  
The goal is to identify key elements within the image and use these details to generate an image as close as possible to the original.


## Tools Used
- **DALL·E (OpenAI)** – Text-to-image generation tool.  
- **Stable Diffusion** – Open-source text-to-image model.  
- **MidJourney** – AI tool for creative and artistic image generation.
- **Gemini**


##  Procedure

1. **Analyze the Image**
   - Observed the original image to note important features such as objects, colors, lighting, background, and style.

2. **Create a Basic Prompt**
   - Wrote a simple textual description of the main scene.

3. **Refine the Prompt**
   - Added details about color, texture, lighting, mood, and artistic style.

4. **Generate the Image**
   - Used a text-to-image AI tool (DALL·E) to produce the image.

5. **Compare and Improve**
   - Compared the generated output with the original and refined the prompt if needed.

###  Original Image

### Prompt Development

#### **Basic Prompt**
> A girl sitting on a park bench under a tree.

#### **Refined Prompt**
> A realistic image of a young woman sitting on a wooden park bench under a large oak tree during autumn. Golden leaves scattered on the ground, warm sunlight filtering through the branches, calm and serene mood.

#### **Final Prompt Used**
> Realistic digital artwork of a young woman sitting on a park bench beneath a tall oak tree with golden autumn leaves. Sunlight rays filtering through branches, warm soft light, natural background, peaceful mood, ultra-detailed, high resolution.

###  Prompt Development
#### **Basic Prompt**
A tiger walking in a river.

#### **Refined Prompt**

Amur tiger wading in shallow stream, low angle wildlife photography, dense green forest background, cinematic rim lighting, ultra shallow depth of field, hyperdetailed 8K.

#### **Final Prompt Used**

A focused Siberian tiger wading toward camera in a shallow forest stream. dramatic photograph. Dense, dark green setting with water splashes and a moody reflective foreground.

| Aspect          | Original                          | Generated                     | Observation                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Objects**     | Amur tiger, stream, forest        | Same                          | All elements present.      |
| **Colors**      | Rich orange, dark greens          | Rich orange, cool greens      | Close match.               |
| **Lighting**    | Low-key, dramatic, rim light      | Low-key, cinematic, rim light | Excellent match.           |
| **Composition** | Extreme low-angle, centered tiger | Low-angle, centered tiger     | Perspective well captured. |
| **Style**       | Hyperrealistic, 8K                | Same                          | Well reproduced.           |
| **Foreground**  | Shallow DoF, reflective water     | Same                          | Excellent fidelity.        |


##  Conclusion

By carefully crafting detailed prompts, the generated image closely resembled the original snowy mountain landscape.  
Minor variations in lighting and tone were observed, but the main composition and color balance were successfully replicated.  
This experiment highlights the importance of **prompt precision** in achieving realistic and accurate AI-generated images.
