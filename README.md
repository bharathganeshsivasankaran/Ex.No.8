## Aim
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts.  
The goal is to identify key elements within the image and use these details to generate an image as close as possible to the original.


## Tools Used
- **DALL·E (OpenAI)** – Text-to-image generation tool.  
- **Stable Diffusion** – Open-source text-to-image model.  
- **MidJourney** – AI tool for creative and artistic image generation.
- **Gemini**


##  Procedure

1. **Analyze the Image**
   - Observed the original image to note important features such as objects, colors, lighting, background, and style.

2. **Create a Basic Prompt**
   - Wrote a simple textual description of the main scene.

3. **Refine the Prompt**
   - Added details about color, texture, lighting, mood, and artistic style.

4. **Generate the Image**
   - Used a text-to-image AI tool (DALL·E) to produce the image.

5. **Compare and Improve**
   - Compared the generated output with the original and refined the prompt if needed.

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Objects     | Waterfall, cliffs, sun, clouds, mountains | Same                                        | All elements present.                    |
| Colors      | Golden-orange sunset, dark blues/greys    | Golden-orange sunset, brighter blues/greens | Close match; less moody.                 |
| Lighting    | Golden hour, dramatic rays                | Golden hour, softer rays                    | Good match; fewer atmospheric details.   |
| Composition | Cliff view, waterfall left                | Cliff view, waterfall centered              | General match; less precise.             |
| Style       | Hyperrealistic, epic                      | Realistic, less epic                        | Style close but toned down.              |
| Key Element | Misty spray, rugged cliffs                | Misty spray, softer cliffs                  | Key features present but softer texture. |



### ✅ Result
The generated image closely matches the original, with only minor variations in color and lighting.  
The composition, tone, and realism were successfully maintained through careful prompt refinement.

##  Conclusion

By carefully crafting detailed prompts, the generated image closely resembled the original snowy mountain landscape.  
Minor variations in lighting and tone were observed, but the main composition and color balance were successfully replicated.  
This experiment highlights the importance of **prompt precision** in achieving realistic and accurate AI-generated images.
